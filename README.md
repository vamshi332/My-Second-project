Project overview:-
Executed an extensive SQL-based data analysis project on a comprehensive Airline Database, applying advanced querying techniques to uncover business insights and operational patterns. Leveraged relational database schemas to write complex, optimized SQL queries that demonstrated practical understanding of data wrangling, aggregation, joins, subqueries, CTEs, ranking functions, and date/time transformations.

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:
 -Transformed and formatted date fields to generate readable time-based reports (e.g., booking dates in yyyy-mmm-dd and Mon-YY formats).
 -Extracted multi-table insights using inner joins to map ticketing and boarding information—retrieving passenger names, IDs, seat allocations, and boarding passes.
 -Identified underutilized resources, such as the least allocated seats and aircrafts without business class, to support capacity planning.
 -Analyzed passenger payment behavior by computing monthly top and bottom spenders using window functions and ranking, driving customer segmentation.
 -Detected round-trip and multi-leg flight patterns to distinguish complex itineraries via grouped counts of unique flight IDs per ticket.
 -Calculated missing records, such as tickets without boarding passes, using NULL filtering and join-based exclusions.
 -Ranked flights by duration, time of day, and location, determining earliest morning flights, longest trips, and peak departure hubs.
 -Filtered aircraft by manufacturer (e.g., Airbus, Boeing) to analyze flight cancellations and delays, providing manufacturer-specific performance metrics.
 -Grouped airport codes by time zone and frequency, surfacing the busiest and least active airports with respect to scheduled departures and arrivals.
 -Built refund reports by aggregating total fare amounts for passengers affected by flight cancellations, aiding in financial recovery forecasting.
